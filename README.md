NBA Player Salary Analysis:
<img width="959" alt="Screenshot 2024-08-10 at 6 06 50 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5be38bbb-397e-4a23-85aa-8ca4619a6092">

1. Bradley Beal's salary disparity makes sense because he plays for the Suns but is currently on a super max contract from Washington, suffered nagging injuries and didn't play much this season and performed well below his expectations

2. Ben Simmons also has a huge salary disparity and is on one of the worst contracts in the league and struggles to stay healthy while Zion Williamson is on a super max extension but also has had some injuries recently

3. Devin Booker is a bit of a surprising addition to this list, considering he did not seem to have a "down" year, but it could be explained by the fact that he is now playing with 2 superstars in Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal, and his sttas are bound to take a hit.

4. Jordan Poole had a very disappointing year on the Wizards after getting paid by the Warriors just one season ago

1. According to my model, Jalen Brunson is getting paid a LOT less than what he should be getting paid. This hypothesis is validated by the fact that he was one of the most impactful players in the playoffs this past season and was eligible for a max extension this offseason (but chose to take a team friendly deal)

2. Some other players like Cade Cunningham, Tyrese Haliburton, Jalen Williams, Tyrese Maxey and Alperen Sengun are also on this list, getting paid a lot less than their predicted values. What's one thing in common between them? They are all on rookie contracts! With their second contracts, these players will get paid a lot more money, in alignment with the value they bring to their teams
